# Getting Started with Astro: A Beginner's Guide to Building Fast, Modern Websites

## Introduction

Astro is a modern web framework designed for speed and simplicity. It lets you build fast, content-rich websites using your favorite tools—like React, Vue, or plain HTML—without sacrificing performance. Whether you're building a personal blog, a marketing site, or documentation, Astro helps you ship less JavaScript and more results.

This guide walks you through everything you need to know to start using Astro, from setup to deployment.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before jumping into code, let’s get your tools ready.

### Prerequisites

You’ll need the following installed:

* **Node.js** (version 18.0 or higher)
    
* **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js)
    
* A code editor, like **Visual Studio Code**
    

### Installing Astro CLI

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

This command will guide you through installing Astro and creating a new project.

### Verifying the Installation

After the installation completes, move into your project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should see your Astro project running locally at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Creating a New Astro Project

### Using the Astro CLI

Astro’s CLI makes starting a project easy:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

You’ll be asked to choose a template (e.g., minimal, blog, docs). Pick one that suits your project.

### Project Structure Overview

Once generated, your project will include:

* `/src`: Your components, pages, and styles
    
* `/public`: Static assets like images or fonts
    
* `/astro.config.mjs`: Configuration file
    
* `package.json`: Manages dependencies and scripts
    

## Building the Basic Pages

### Creating a Homepage

In the `/src/pages` directory, create `index.astro`. This becomes your homepage.

```plaintext
---
// No frontmatter needed yet
---
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Home</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Astro</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Understanding Astro Components

Astro components are `.astro` files with a mix of HTML, JavaScript, and frontmatter. You can also use JSX, Svelte, Vue, or Preact inside Astro components.

### Writing Your First Astro Component

Create a component in `/src/components/Header.astro`:

```plaintext
---
const { title } = Astro.props;
---
<header>
  <h1>{title}</h1>
</header>
```

Use it in a page:

```plaintext
---
import Header from '../components/Header.astro';
---
<Header title="My Site" />
```

### Adding Additional Pages

Create `about.astro` in the `/pages` directory to add a new page:

```plaintext
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>This is the about page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Routing in Astro

Astro automatically handles routing based on the `/pages` directory. A file named `about.astro` becomes `/about`.

### Creating Links Between Pages

Use standard anchor tags:

```html
<a href="/about">About</a>
```

Astro doesn’t require special routing components.

## Styling Your Project

### Using Built-In CSS

You can write standard CSS in `.astro` files:

```plaintext
<style>
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

### Global vs. Component Styles

Component styles are scoped automatically. For global styles, create a CSS file like `/src/styles/global.css` and import it in your `layout.astro` or `index.astro`.

### Integrating CSS Frameworks (Optional)

Want to use Tailwind or another framework? You can.

#### Installing Tailwind CSS

```bash
npx astro add tailwind
```

Then, configure and import it in your project.

#### Applying Framework Styles

Use utility classes as needed:

```html
<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Hello Tailwind</h1>
```

## Adding Dynamic Content

### Fetching Data from an API

In any `.astro` file, you can fetch data in the frontmatter:

```plaintext
---
const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
const posts = await res.json();
---
<ul>
  {posts.map(post => <li>{post.title}</li>)}
</ul>
```

### Using Astro's Built-In Data Support

Astro supports `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` for dynamic routes and content.

## Optimizing Your Astro Site

### Performance Considerations

Astro ships only the code that the browser needs. That means less JavaScript by default and faster load times.

### Reviewing Astro's Speed Features

* Partial hydration
    
* Static site generation
    
* Zero JS by default
    
* Optimized image handling
    

### SEO Setup

Add meta tags in your `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  <title>My Page</title>
  <meta name="description" content="This is a sample Astro page.">
</head>
```

Astro makes it easy to build sites that are fast and SEO-friendly.

## Deploying Your Astro Project

### Building for Production

Run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Astro generates static files in the `/dist` folder.

### Deployment Options

You can deploy Astro to any static host:

* **Vercel**
    
* **Netlify**
    
* **GitHub Pages**
    
* **Cloudflare Pages**
    

#### Example: Deploying to Netlify

1. Push your project to GitHub.
    
2. Connect your repo in Netlify.
    
3. Set the build command to `npm run build` and output folder to `dist`.
    

## Conclusion

Astro gives you the power of modern web frameworks with the speed of static sites. You’ve learned how to:

* Set up your environment
    
* Create and style pages
    
* Use components
    
* Fetch dynamic content
    
* Optimize and deploy your site
    

This is just the beginning. Astro also supports markdown, server-side rendering, integrations, and more.
